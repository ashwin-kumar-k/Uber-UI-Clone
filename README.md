# Uber UI Clone

This project is an Uber UI clone, showcasing a user interface similar to the popular ride-hailing app Uber. It utilizes Apple's MapKit for search auto-completion, real-time directions, and estimated time of arrival (ETA) functionalities. 

## Features

- **Search Auto-Completion**: The app offers a seamless search experience with auto-completion suggestions for locations, making it easy for users to input their desired pick-up and drop-off points.
  
- **Real-time Directions**: Users can receive real-time directions to their destination, ensuring a smooth navigation experience throughout the trip.
  
- **Estimated Time of Arrival**: The app provides users with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) based on the selected route, allowing them to plan their journey more effectively.
  
- **Various Ride Options**: Users can choose from various ride options, including ride, package, rentals, and moto, providing flexibility based on their needs.
  
- **Real-time Fare Calculation**: The app calculates the fare in real-time based on the distance traveled and the selected ride type, ensuring transparency and accuracy in pricing.
  
- **Trip Cancellation**: Users have the option to cancel their trip if needed, providing them with flexibility and control over their travel plans.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: The app's user interface is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern UI framework.
  
- **MapKit**: Apple's MapKit framework is utilized for map-related functionalities such as search auto-completion, real-time directions, and ETA calculation.
  
- **UIKit Integration**: UIKit is seamlessly integrated with SwiftUI for certain functionalities where SwiftUI's capabilities are limited.
  
- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability of code.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device running iOS 14.0 or later.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to enable user accounts and personalized experiences.
  
- **Real-time Tracking**: Integrate real-time tracking functionalities to provide users with live updates on the status of their ride.
  
- **Payment Integration**: Add payment integration to allow users to pay for their rides directly within the app.
  
- **Localization**: Implement localization to support multiple languages and regions, making the app accessible to a broader audience.
  
- **Driver Features**: Develop features for drivers, such as accepting ride requests, updating ride status, and managing earnings.
